MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller.
It is a way of structuring our code and files
It keeps code more modular, resuable, and easier to read.

Views are where we create our HTML templates that a user sees in the browser.
Models are how we describe our data structure and use them to interact with the database.
Controllers form the link between the views and models. They use models to get data and then pass that data into a view
